# Magnetize
# Magnetize is a board game for two players that involves black and white pieces on a rectangular grid; 
# unlike many board games, the board stands up vertically. The objective is to form a square of pieces of your color. 
# Players take turns dropping pieces in chosen columns in the board, where they fall to the lowest possible level. 
# Players can also temporarily turn on a magnet," causing all their pieces to slide as far to the left or right as 
# possible within their rows, and then to cling for some number of turns before falling downwards if they are unsupported.
